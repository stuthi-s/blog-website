      "body": "The Indus Valley Civilization is one of the oldest in the world. It flourished around 2500 BCE in present-day India and Pakistan. Cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were known for their advanced town planning. They had well-laid streets, drainage systems, and brick houses. The people were skilled in crafts, trade, and agriculture. Their script remains undeciphered, adding mystery to their culture. The civilization showed a deep understanding of urban life. It traded with distant regions, including Mesopotamia. Its decline remains a topic of debate among historians. The Indus Valley remains a proud chapter in Indiaâ€™s ancient history.",
